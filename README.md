Delivery Web App written in HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, SQL, MySQL

This project was targeting delivery services such as Door Dash, Uber Eats, Grub Hub but with more of a Post Mates vibe. Anyone can sign up and add whatever they sell whether it's services like software engineering or groceries. A restaurant  can add their menu. A dispensary can add their inventory. A mechanic can add their tune up and service plans. A teacher can add tutoring plans.

Search any zip code in the world and McDonalds, Taco Bell and Subway will appear. You can log in as any of the 3 and place and fill orders to test everything out. When you log in if you hear chimes it's alerting you to orders.

The businesses which can be a person, a business or corporation can choose the keywords they want to appear in custom searches so you could find all contractors in 78750 or restaurants in 78759 or software engineers in 77304.

Search by location to find whatever you want locally!

This project was initially not intended to be free so there are no comments in the code and it is complex. A wise developer once taught me security through obscurity means job security.
