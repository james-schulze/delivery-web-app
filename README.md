# delivery-web-app
Delivery Web App written in HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, SQL, MySQL

This project was targeting delivery services such as Door Dash, Uber Eats, Grub Hub but with more of a Post Mates vibe. Anyone can sign up and add whatever they sell whether it's services like software engineering or groceries. A restaurant  can add their menu. A dispensary can add their inventory. A mechanic can add their tune up and service plans. A teacher can add tutoring mentoring plans.

Search by location to find whatever you want locally!

This project was initially not intended to be free so there are no comments in the code and it is complex. A wise developer once taught me security through obscurity means job security.

I will host a demo online for anyone to checkout at http://cryptoleaks.news/delivery

If you would like to hire me to expand the project then email me at schulze.james@protonmail.com
