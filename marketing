"Restaurants are barely surviving. Delivery apps will kill them." Washington Post

"As Diners Flock to Delivery Apps, Restaurants Fear for Their Future." NY Times

“We just got our year-end financials back. … Not only did we lose money (a given, pandemic and all), but to add insult to injury, we spent $35,000 on delivery service fees this year,” Caitlin @Ronan , LA Times

**PRESS RELEASE**

Drive Zero https://idrivezero.com has recently launched aiming to get rid of the 30% fees charged by delivery services which are killing local businesses.

Drive Zero is introducing a zero fee platform for restaurants, mainstream retailers, and individuals looking to have their goods and services sold online with delivery options available. Due to the ever increasing customer backlash over fees charged by current delivery providers Drive Zero has been introduced.

Cofounder / CEO James Schulze has stated "Far too many family owned restaurants have been lost in the pandemic due to exorbitant fees charged by delivery services taking just as much or more than they pay in taxes, this is just not right."

DoorDash, GrubHub, Uber Eats accused of charging 'exorbitant fees,' using 'monopoly power' A new lawsuit against the major food-delivery services accuses them of charging "exorbitant fees" and forcing restaurants to raise prices for dine-in customers.

Drive Zero offers an annual verification program for only $99 which is less than restaurants pay each day to Door Dash, Uber Eats and other delivery services and that's it! No more fees, no percentage of sales taken away, no more struggling to survive. How would you like to pay $30,000K of every $100,000K you make not to taxes, but to a delivery service? How can we afford to do this? We can't, but were going to do it anyway and still give 10% to charity!

Users can order from businesses with or without verifying their account, however, once they do they can become a driver which is $99 annually and allows them to choose their own price per minute, per hour or per delivery! Work when you want, where you want, for what you want!

A better alternative has arrived, start helping local businesses survive the pandemic today!
